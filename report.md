# SmartNeta Modernization Report (Customer-Facing)

## 1. Executive Summary

SmartNeta’s current applications deliver valuable election operations, but they are constrained by outdated frameworks, monolithic design, and performance bottlenecks that risk reliability during peak usage. This report summarizes the current risks and proposes a lean, low-risk, high-impact modernization plan that can be delivered in four quarters without over-engineering. The plan preserves existing capabilities, improves performance and security, and positions the platform for reliable statewide operations.

Key takeaways at a glance:
- Immediate security hardening and framework upgrades (Q1) to remove critical CVEs
- Implement testing framework with unit tests, integration tests and E2E tests 
- Performance uplift via indexes, pooling, caching, pagination; target <200ms p95
- Lean architecture (no gateways/meshes/buses) appropriate for current scale
- Full API parity with enhanced consistency and documentation
- Predictable, phased delivery suited to a 2-dev + 1-QA core team

## 2. As-Is Overview (What exists today)

- Mobile: Ionic 3 + Angular 5 (Cordova), SQLite offline cache, Firebase push
- Admin: Vue 2 + Vuetify
- Backend: Spring Boot 2 (monolith), MySQL, Shiro-based auth, Ehcache
- Integrations: CSV imports, file uploads, SMS, email, notifications
- Deployment: manual server deployment, limited monitoring

#### 2.0 Business Capabilities Covered Today
- Voter/citizen data search and management
- Volunteer operations and OTP-based auth
- Complaint capture with images and routing
- Surveys (questions and responses) and simple analytics
- Hierarchical geo data: State → AC/PC → Ward → Booth

#### 2.1 Architecture Snapshot
```
Mobile (Ionic 3 / Angular 5)
Admin (Vue 2)
        │
        ▼
Spring Boot 2 Monolith (Shiro, Ehcache)
        │                 └─ Local FS uploads (images/CSVs)
        ▼
MySQL 8
```

### 2.1 Critical Issues (High risk to operations)
- Security: outdated Angular/Ionic/Spring/Shiro with known CVEs; wildcard CORS; no rate limiting; hardcoded secrets
- Performance: heavy endpoints (citizen search, dashboard), no connection pooling strategy, limited caching, synchronous IO
- Reliability: single-node backend and DB, no autoscaling, lack of health checks, no structured incident alerting
- Data Integrity: CSV imports without robust validation; limited audit trail
- Developer Velocity: no CI/CD, low test coverage, manual releases

### 2.2 Performance Pain Points in Key Flows
- Authentication (OTP): sequential calls, occasional timeouts under load
- Citizen search/filter: table scans, missing composite indexes; slow >3s under peak
- Dashboard aggregation: multiple joins, computed metrics on the fly; spikes >5s
- Complaint submission with images: blocking file IO; intermittent 500s on large uploads
- Notification fetch/mark-seen: N+1 queries; slow on high-notification users

```
As-Is Interaction (simplified)
Mobile/Admin → REST (single service) → MySQL
                  ↘ Filesystem (uploads)
```

### 2.3 Root-Cause Summary (Why these issues occur)
- Outdated Angular/Ionic/Spring/Shiro with known CVEs and perf regressions
- Monolithic controller logic mixing business rules and IO (hard to optimize)
- DB schema indexes not aligned to hot queries (search, dashboard)
- Synchronous file processing on app node; no backpressure for large uploads
- Wildcard CORS and missing input validation increase attack surface
- Minimal caching strategy; no consistent pagination contracts across endpoints

### 2.4 Evidence From Codebase (Representative Hotspots)
- `VolunteerController.search` uses POST with broad filters, likely scanning large tables
- `Dashboard` endpoints aggregate across citizen/booth/ward on-the-fly
- File endpoints write to local disk; image downloads via app process
- CORS `*` on controllers; Shiro RC version; JWT library outdated

## 3. To-Be Overview (Lean, pragmatic target)

- Keep the system simple: modular Spring Boot 3 service modules within one deployable (or a small set where necessary)
- Direct REST, no API gateway, no event bus; Redis for session/cache; PostgreSQL for reliability and features
- Ionic 7 + Angular 17 mobile, NgRx for state, smarter offline sync
- CI/CD with automated tests; Docker for reproducible builds; basic monitoring via Actuator

```
To-Be Interaction (lean)
Mobile/Admin → REST (modular Spring Boot 3) → PostgreSQL/Redis
                          ↘ Object storage (files)
```

### 3.1 Design Principles (Why this is right-sized)
- Keep what works (REST) and fix known pain (indexes, caching, pagination)
- Upgrade frameworks to secure, supported versions (Angular/Ionic/Spring)
- Avoid premature complexity: no API gateway, no Kafka; re-evaluate post adoption
- Invest in tests and CI/CD to protect quality with small team
- Establish observability floor (health, metrics, structured logs)

## 4. Side-by-Side: What improves and why it matters

- Security: OAuth2/JWT, secret management, TLS enforced, validated inputs → reduces breach risk
- Performance: indexes, pooling, Redis cache, pagination & async file handling → consistent <200ms APIs (p95)
- Reliability: health checks, graceful restarts, backups, basic alerts → 99.5% uptime target
- Dev Velocity: CI/CD, tests, API specs → faster, safer releases
- UX: modern UI kit, accessibility, offline-first → higher task success and reduced support load

#### 4.1 Detailed Improvements Matrix
- Authentication: consolidated OTP + JWT; device binding optional → fewer failures
- Search: composite indexes + server-side pagination → predictable <500ms results
- Dashboard: precomputed summaries or optimized queries → p95 <800ms
- Files: object storage + streamed uploads/downloads → fewer 500s, stable throughput
- Notifications: batched queries; mark-seen in bulk → no more N+1 latency

## 5. API Coverage Guarantee

- Exhaustive mapping completed: every current endpoint has a to-be equivalent
- Consolidations applied (e.g., master data), no loss of functionality
- Improved consistency: versioned paths, uniform responses, better errors
- See `smartneta-api-comparison-as-is-vs-to-be.md` for the full mapping list

## 6. Migration Plan (Quarterly, minimal risk)

- Q1: Security and framework upgrades; test harness; CI/CD; DB hardening
- Q2: Modularize backend within Spring Boot 3; PostgreSQL migration; Redis cache; indexes
- Q3: Business modules (complaints, surveys, files, reports); Actuator monitoring; backups
- Q4: Mobile modernization (Ionic 7 + Angular 17, NgRx, offline sync); UAT; cutover

Milestones are defined as JIRA epics/stories in `smartneta-to-be-architecture-hld.md`.

### 6.1 Deliverables & Acceptance per Quarter
- Q1 Acceptance: No critical/high CVEs; CI/CD green; smoke/perf tests passing; <1s p95 on auth/login
- Q2 Acceptance: PostgreSQL live with zero data loss; citizen search p95 <500ms; error rate <0.5%
- Q3 Acceptance: Complaint/survey/file/report modules refactored; backups verified; MTTR <30m on drills
- Q4 Acceptance: Mobile app GA (Ionic 7 + Angular 17); UAT sign-off; production cutover with <30m read-only

### 6.2 Backward Compatibility Strategy
- Maintain legacy endpoints behind versioned router during migration
- Provide OpenAPI specs + SDKs for clients; dual-run during cutover
- Feature flags for progressive rollouts and safe rollback

## 7. KPIs and Acceptance Targets

- API latency: <200ms p95 (citizen search <500ms with filters)
- App launch: <3s warm start, <5s cold start
- Availability: 99.5% with backups and restore drills
- Test coverage: 80% backend, 70% mobile critical paths
- Security: zero critical/high CVEs; quarterly pen test clean

#### 7.1 Observability & Dashboards (at a glance)
- API latency (p50/p95) by endpoint and module
- Error rates (4xx/5xx) with alerts >0.5% for 5 minutes
- Resource utilization; GC pauses; DB pool saturation
- Business KPIs: OTP success rate, complaint TAT, survey completion rate

# SmartNeta Major Performance Red Flags (Backend + Ionic)

Scope: Non-security performance issues that threaten meeting the targets (high concurrency, 10M+ citizens, low-latency SLOs).

## 1) Data Access & Query Scale (Backend)
- Unbounded/broad queries on large tables
  - Citizen search allows weak/absent filters; risks full/large scans on 10M+ rows.
  - Dashboard aggregates computed on-the-fly across multiple joins.
- Missing composite/covering indexes
  - Queries on (assemblyId, wardId, boothId), voterId, and common name/dob fields lack matching indexes.
- SELECT * and verbose payloads
  - List endpoints fetch all columns instead of light DTO projections.
- N+1 access patterns
  - Citizen/detail and dashboard flows join lazily across related entities.
- Lack of enforced pagination/limits
  - Endpoints accept arbitrary sizes; server does not cap page size or reject unfettered queries.

## 2) Caching & Computation Hotspots (Backend)
- No short‑TTL cache for dashboard aggregates
  - Recomputes on each request; spikes latency under load.
- Master data retrieved per request
  - States/AC/PC/wards/booths repeatedly fetched without shared cache.
- No client validators for freshness
  - Missing ETag/Last‑Modified; static/config endpoints not cached at client/CDN.

## 3) I/O & File Handling (Backend)
- Synchronous file uploads/downloads on app node
  - Files buffered to local filesystem; blocks request threads; causes GC/memory pressure.
- Large responses not streamed
  - No output streaming for big downloads/exports; increases memory footprint.

## 4) Connection/Server Runtime (Backend)
- Untuned HikariCP/HTTP server settings
  - Default pool sizes/timeouts; risk of saturation, long tail latencies, and resource pinning.
- Missing slow‑query logging and per‑endpoint metrics
  - Hard to identify/tune hotspots; no SLO enforcement in CI/ops.

## 5) Client Behavior & API Integration (Ionic)
- Eager, duplicate API calls on app/home
  - App settings/actions/news/notifications fetched on multiple pages without TTL or single‑flight.
- Auto/bulk data fetch
  - Historic behavior to prefetch citizen data; search sometimes triggers without strict filters.
- No client‑side debounce/backoff
  - Rapid repeated requests; no jittered retries; ignores 429 signals.
- Master data re-fetched frequently
  - Missing local TTL/versioning; re-requests states/AC/PC/wards/booths across pages.

## 6) Payload Discipline (Both)
- Over‑verbose list payloads
  - Heavy nested objects and attachments included in lists; increases bandwidth/latency.
- Lack of server‑side response shaping
  - No standard DTOs for lists vs detail; inconsistent pagination contracts.

## 7) Impact vs Performance‑Reqs Targets
- p95 latency at scale jeopardized by:
  - Broad scans (citizen search), un‑cached dashboard aggregates, N+1 joins.
- Concurrency limits threatened by:
  - Untuned pools/timeouts; synchronous file IO; heavy responses.
- Data volume (10M+) risks:
  - Missing composite/covering indexes; unfettered queries; lack of enforced limits.

## 8) High‑Leverage Fixes (Non‑security; minimal change footprint)
- Enforce server‑side guardrails
  - Mandatory filters (assemblyId/wardId/boothId) for citizen search; hard max page size; reject broad queries.
- Index & query optimization
  - Add indexes for (assemblyId, wardId, boothId), voterId, name/dob; convert hot endpoints to projections; remove SELECT *.
- Short‑TTL caches
  - Cache dashboard aggregates (60–120s); cache master data in app with Redis fallback.
- Stream & offload file IO
  - Stream uploads/downloads; move binaries to object storage (or dedicated file server) and out of the app process.
- Client request shaping
  - TTL + single‑flight for settings/actions; debounce user search; centralized notifications/news with TTL; eliminate auto/bulk fetch.
- Observability & tuning
  - Enable slow‑query log; add per‑endpoint p50/p95 dashboards; tune Hikari/HTTP timeouts and pool sizes; add load tests to CI.
