# SmartNeta Modernization Report (Customer-Facing)

## 1. Executive Summary

SmartNeta’s current applications deliver valuable election operations, but they are constrained by outdated frameworks, monolithic design, and performance bottlenecks that risk reliability during peak usage. This report summarizes the current risks and proposes a lean, low-risk, high-impact modernization plan that can be delivered in four quarters without over-engineering. The plan preserves existing capabilities, improves performance and security, and positions the platform for reliable statewide operations.

Key takeaways at a glance:
- Immediate security hardening and framework upgrades (Q1) to remove critical CVEs
- Performance uplift via indexes, pooling, caching, pagination; target <200ms p95
- Lean architecture (no gateways/meshes/buses) appropriate for current scale
- Full API parity with enhanced consistency and documentation
- Predictable, phased delivery suited to a 2-dev + 1-QA core team

## 2. As-Is Overview (What exists today)

- Mobile: Ionic 3 + Angular 5 (Cordova), SQLite offline cache, Firebase push
- Admin: Vue 2 + Vuetify
- Backend: Spring Boot 2 (monolith), MySQL, Shiro-based auth, Ehcache
- Integrations: CSV imports, file uploads, SMS, email, notifications
- Deployment: manual server deployment, limited monitoring

#### 2.0 Business Capabilities Covered Today
- Voter/citizen data search and management
- Volunteer operations and OTP-based auth
- Complaint capture with images and routing
- Surveys (questions and responses) and simple analytics
- Hierarchical geo data: State → AC/PC → Ward → Booth

#### 2.1 Architecture Snapshot
```
Mobile (Ionic 3 / Angular 5)
Admin (Vue 2)
        │
        ▼
Spring Boot 2 Monolith (Shiro, Ehcache)
        │                 └─ Local FS uploads (images/CSVs)
        ▼
MySQL 8
```

### 2.1 Critical Issues (High risk to operations)
- Security: outdated Angular/Ionic/Spring/Shiro with known CVEs; wildcard CORS; no rate limiting; hardcoded secrets
- Performance: heavy endpoints (citizen search, dashboard), no connection pooling strategy, limited caching, synchronous IO
- Reliability: single-node backend and DB, no autoscaling, lack of health checks, no structured incident alerting
- Data Integrity: CSV imports without robust validation; limited audit trail
- Developer Velocity: no CI/CD, low test coverage, manual releases

### 2.2 Performance Pain Points in Key Flows
- Authentication (OTP): sequential calls, occasional timeouts under load
- Citizen search/filter: table scans, missing composite indexes; slow >3s under peak
- Dashboard aggregation: multiple joins, computed metrics on the fly; spikes >5s
- Complaint submission with images: blocking file IO; intermittent 500s on large uploads
- Notification fetch/mark-seen: N+1 queries; slow on high-notification users

```
As-Is Interaction (simplified)
Mobile/Admin → REST (single service) → MySQL
                  ↘ Filesystem (uploads)
```

### 2.3 Root-Cause Summary (Why these issues occur)
- Outdated Angular/Ionic/Spring/Shiro with known CVEs and perf regressions
- Monolithic controller logic mixing business rules and IO (hard to optimize)
- DB schema indexes not aligned to hot queries (search, dashboard)
- Synchronous file processing on app node; no backpressure for large uploads
- Wildcard CORS and missing input validation increase attack surface
- Minimal caching strategy; no consistent pagination contracts across endpoints

### 2.4 Evidence From Codebase (Representative Hotspots)
- `VolunteerController.search` uses POST with broad filters, likely scanning large tables
- `Dashboard` endpoints aggregate across citizen/booth/ward on-the-fly
- File endpoints write to local disk; image downloads via app process
- CORS `*` on controllers; Shiro RC version; JWT library outdated

## 3. To-Be Overview (Lean, pragmatic target)

- Keep the system simple: modular Spring Boot 3 service modules within one deployable (or a small set where necessary)
- Direct REST, no API gateway, no event bus; Redis for session/cache; PostgreSQL for reliability and features
- Ionic 7 + Angular 17 mobile, NgRx for state, smarter offline sync
- CI/CD with automated tests; Docker for reproducible builds; basic monitoring via Actuator

```
To-Be Interaction (lean)
Mobile/Admin → REST (modular Spring Boot 3) → PostgreSQL/Redis
                          ↘ Object storage (files)
```

### 3.1 Design Principles (Why this is right-sized)
- Keep what works (REST) and fix known pain (indexes, caching, pagination)
- Upgrade frameworks to secure, supported versions (Angular/Ionic/Spring)
- Avoid premature complexity: no API gateway, no Kafka; re-evaluate post adoption
- Invest in tests and CI/CD to protect quality with small team
- Establish observability floor (health, metrics, structured logs)

## 4. Side-by-Side: What improves and why it matters

- Security: OAuth2/JWT, secret management, TLS enforced, validated inputs → reduces breach risk
- Performance: indexes, pooling, Redis cache, pagination & async file handling → consistent <200ms APIs (p95)
- Reliability: health checks, graceful restarts, backups, basic alerts → 99.5% uptime target
- Dev Velocity: CI/CD, tests, API specs → faster, safer releases
- UX: modern UI kit, accessibility, offline-first → higher task success and reduced support load

#### 4.1 Detailed Improvements Matrix
- Authentication: consolidated OTP + JWT; device binding optional → fewer failures
- Search: composite indexes + server-side pagination → predictable <500ms results
- Dashboard: precomputed summaries or optimized queries → p95 <800ms
- Files: object storage + streamed uploads/downloads → fewer 500s, stable throughput
- Notifications: batched queries; mark-seen in bulk → no more N+1 latency

## 5. API Coverage Guarantee

- Exhaustive mapping completed: every current endpoint has a to-be equivalent
- Consolidations applied (e.g., master data), no loss of functionality
- Improved consistency: versioned paths, uniform responses, better errors
- See `smartneta-api-comparison-as-is-vs-to-be.md` for the full mapping list

## 6. Migration Plan (Quarterly, minimal risk)

- Q1: Security and framework upgrades; test harness; CI/CD; DB hardening
- Q2: Modularize backend within Spring Boot 3; PostgreSQL migration; Redis cache; indexes
- Q3: Business modules (complaints, surveys, files, reports); Actuator monitoring; backups
- Q4: Mobile modernization (Ionic 7 + Angular 17, NgRx, offline sync); UAT; cutover

Milestones are defined as JIRA epics/stories in `smartneta-to-be-architecture-hld.md`.

## 8. Visual Architecture Snapshots

```
As-Is (monolith on a single node)
[ Mobile ] → [ Spring Boot 2 Monolith ] → [ MySQL ]
                               ↘ files on server
```

```
To-Be (lean modular)
[ Mobile/Admin ] → [ Spring Boot 3 Modular App ] → [ PostgreSQL | Redis ]
                                          ↘ [ Object Storage ]
```

### 8.1 Data Flow Highlights (key paths)
- Auth: OTP → JWT → session cache; minimal round-trips
- Search: indexed queries + pagination; consistent contracts across clients
- Files: direct-to-storage streams where possible; signed URLs for downloads
- Sync: mobile offline queue with conflict resolution rules

## 9. Why choose this plan (business case)

- Fastest path to risk reduction: fix security and performance in Q1/Q2
- Lean by design: avoids costly gateways/meshes/streams until justified by load
- Clear, testable KPIs: measurable improvements across latency, reliability, and quality
- Backward compatible: API parity maintained; phased rollout avoids downtime
- Team-fit: feasible for 2 devs + 1 tester; predictable delivery with quarterly demos

### 9.1 Risk Register & Mitigations
- Data migration issues → rehearsal runs, checksums, fallback snapshots
- Performance regressions → baseline perf tests; canary releases
- User disruption → feature flags, phased switch, training materials
- Scope creep → change control; prioritize Q1/Q2 risk reduction

### 9.2 Objections We Anticipate (and our responses)
- “Why not add a gateway/mesh now?” → Current load doesn’t justify added ops cost; revisit when scale demands
- “Can we skip tests to go faster?” → Tests protect small team velocity; saves time after month 2
- “Why PostgreSQL?” → Better reliability features, JSONB, indexing options; mature migration tooling

## 10. Next Steps

- Approve Q1 scope (security, upgrades, CI/CD, DB hardening)
- Schedule stakeholder demo cadence (end of each quarter)
- Provide staging credentials for integration testing
- Confirm data retention and backup RPO/RTO requirements
